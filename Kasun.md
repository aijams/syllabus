Hi, I'm *Kasun Wimalasena* and I'm a second year Physics grad student.\
I'm working on **Transition Edge Sensors** for a balloon borne gamma ray telescope. We are developing a new type of detectors with thick absorbing material deposited by electroplating method. Yes there are plenty of chemistry involved and No I haven't learned chemistry before So I'm going through a steep learning curve these days.\
In my free time I usually play PC games but I don't have that much of free time now as much as I used to have. I also love working on cars.

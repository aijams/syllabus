* Hi, I'm *Kasun Wimalasena* and I'm a second year Physics grad student.
* I'm working with Prof. Fabian Kislat on the development of **Transition Edge Sensors** for a balloon borne gamma ray telescope. We are developing a new type of detectors with thick absorbing material deposited by electroplating method. Yes there are plenty of chemistry involved and No I haven't learned chemistry before so I'm going through a steep learning curve these days.
* In my free time I usually play PC games but I don't have that much of free time now as much as I used to have. I also love working on cars.


* Here is a picture of... well I have no idea what it is! I just found it in the internet moments ago

Hi, everyone, this is Kaushik.

I'm from India and joined UNH last spring(2022). I'm a Ph.D. student at IAM. This course is one of the required courses of the program I'm in and will also help a lot throughout my Ph.D. 

Currently, I'm working with prof. James Clemmons with prof. Kai Germaschewski is my co-advisor where my primary work is to study the plasma state of matter in the upper atmosphere by analyzing the data accumulated by the rockets launched since 1987. But obviously, I'll be working on those data sets which are still need to be analyzed. During the work simulating those data and creating a model out of that, HPC is a must needed tool. Hence, I'm looking forward to having a wonderful experience in this class. Finger crossed.

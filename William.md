Hello, I'm William.

You can call me Will.

My username is NHGrizzly because I have lived in New Hampshire my whole life and I love bears. Like a grizzly, I don't completely fit in in New Hampshire so I hope to travel after graduating.

Bears are illegal to own so I settle for dogs. My mom has a yellow lab, enshrined below. My favorite breed is Saint Bernard.

My favorite language that I know is C because of its use in microcontroller programming. My least favorite language that I know is Rocky Mountain BASIC. It is archaic and I have to maintain an Agilent test stand base in it for work. Here is a terrible code block from that test base:

     2960 SPIN:
     2970 GOTO SPIN

Deleting these lines breaks the test stand. We still don't know why. I have been denied 4 proposals to replace the entire test stand.

Hello, I'm William.

You can call me Will.

My username is NHGrizzly because I have lived in New Hampshire my whole life and I love bears. Like a grizzly, I don't completely fit in in New Hampshire so I hope to travel after graduating.

My favorite language that I know is C because of its use in microcontroller programming. My least favorite language that I know is Rocky Mountain BASIC. It is archaic and I have to maintain an Agilent test stand base in it for work. Here is a terrible code block from that test base:
`Spin:
Goto: Spin`
Deleting these lines breaks the test stand. We don't know why.

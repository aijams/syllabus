## Introduction
I am a second year graduate student in the physics department from Pakistan. My research interests are in the field of condensed matter physics. I have worked in mesoscopic physics i.e, 2-D materials, thin film structural changes in UHV and high-temperature environments, and transport phenomena in quantum dots. Currently working on the experiment side of zero energy-Majorana fermion modes for topological quantum computation applications.
## Interests and Hobbies 
I like to go out and explore nature, ideally, I want to visit all continents. My other hobbies are nature photography, cooking, and hiking.
## Sports
* Snooker 
* Cricket
* Watching football 
## Future Goals
* Make some contribution to the understanding of the fundamentals of mesoscopic physics
* Finish my Ph.D. as soon as possible
* World tour

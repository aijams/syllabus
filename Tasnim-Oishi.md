# Introduction
## Background
My name is Talukder Musfika Tasnim Oishi and I am currently pursuing my PhD in Materials Science and Engineering. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Bangladesh. Being from a tropical country, this is my first time experiencing snow and I have been enjoying the nature here a lot. 

## Research Interests
My research interests lie in the field of Materials Science and Engineering, specifically in developing new advanced materials and characterizing their properties using computational mechanics. My goal is to understand and control the material's microstructure-property relationships and ultimately to improve their performance in various applications.

## Aspirations
I am excited to be a part of the IAM 851.01: High-Performance Computing class this semester and to expand my knowledge and understanding of high-performance computing in relation to materials science and engineering.

## Hobbies
In my leisure time, I engage in various activities such as reading, drawing, and watching anime and movies. I also have a pet Betta fish named Ares whom I take pleasure in caring for.

## Introductions

* [Syllabus](https://github.com/unh-hpc-2023/syllabus/blob/main/README.md)

* Your Instructor

* [Students](Students)

## Supercomputers

### What's this?

![fishercat](images/fisher-cat.jpg)

Well, that's *fishercat*. fishercat is an IBM PowerXCell 8i (Cell
processor) based cluster that was used for most of this class. It's physicall still upstairs in Morse Hall, but it's essentially ancient.

Okay, so in reality it looks more like three of these in a rack:

### The next generation

* [UNH Celebrates First-in-the-State Supercomputing Capabilities](http://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/2013/11/unh-celebrates-first-state-supercomputing-capabilities)

* [UNH unveiling new Cray supercomputer](http://boston.cbslocal.com/2013/11/03/unh-unveiling-new-cray-supercomputer-slated-for-physics-research/). Trillian was UNH's first Cray.

* UNH's latest supercomputer is also a Cray, called [Marvin](https://plasma-use.sr.unh.edu/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Marvin), which has
  been installed in 2020.

## Sign up for github and the class

* Sign up for [github](https://github.com) (unless you already have a
  github account, then you can just use that).

* Let me know your github user id, so I can add you to the
  "organization" (`unh-hpc-2023`) for this class.

* Sign up for this
  [github classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/98176993-unh-hpc-2023).

* Sign up for the [class slack](https://join.slack.com/t/newworkspace-o8k5214/shared_invite/zt-1nwjejb0k-AlPLvzJwx03GKE9785ADWQ).

## GitHub wiki

This class, as I've already shown you, uses GitHub to store the class
materials, and we'll use more of GitHub as we go, including me storing
sample code, and you forking it, and using it to store your code
assignments.

Across GitHub, there are a number of places that allow the user to
write simple text with a bit of added mark-up and have it formatted
nicely, e.g., as headlines, or to include code fragments. In
particular, the wiki that comes with the `class` repository has the
class notes stored in that format, which is actually called
`markdown`. `markdown` is one flavor of a lightweight mark-up
language, similar but not the same as used, e.g., on wikipedia, as
this one is more tailored towards coding. An overview of the supported
mark-up is available from
[GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

#### Your turn

Pick a page (like this or any other one), and there should be an edit
button near the top. Clicking that will show you the source (which you
can then edit, but you don't necessarily want to save the changes if
you're just playing around, you can use "preview" to just try things
out at first). Take a look how the plain text you're editing relates
to the formatted page that's generated from it.

Create a new page about yourself. To do this, click the "New Page"
button, then use your name as the title and write something. After
saving the page, go the [Students](Students) page, edit it and add
a link to the page you just created.

Eventually, I'd like you to create a page with some information about
yourself (or something else -- whatever you want to share), use some
formatting, and add a picture, but I'll leave that for a first
homework.

### Homework

* Finish signing up for the accounts.

* Create a wiki page about yourself (or your favorite animal / hobby / whatever). Use some markup and add a picture or something.

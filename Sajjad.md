I am a Ph.D. student in the Mechanical Engineering department.
The field of my study is crystal plasticity which deals with the crystal structure of metallic materials.

Futsal is my favorite sport and I enjoy playing it. During my time in Iran, I played futsal three times a week.
Despite the fact that I'm not good at music, I enjoy listening to it a lot.
Movies are also on my list of favorite things to do. I used to watch two or three movies a week back in Iran, but as a Ph.D. student, I have no free time. That was something I missed a lot.

## Short bio
Hello everyone, I am Xiaochen, currently a graduate student from the CS department. Prior to UNH, I spent several years in **Minnesota** and **Missouri**. Originally from **China**, I've been studying, living, and working in the States for more than 12 years. So far, I've been enjoying living in the New England area.

### What I like 
- Travel \[bucket list: **_Alaska_**\]
- Soccer \[used to play, but now I am too old. Sigh...\]
- Classical music \[Found **Chopin** is so soothing\]
- Stargazing \[I was intended to major in Astronomy; but...\]

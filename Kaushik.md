Hi, everyone, this is Kaushik Bhanja.

I'm from India. I'm in the IAM program, doing my Ph.D. and this is my 2nd year here at UNH. In a word, I'm in love with the atmosphere of the university campus and its world-class research. 

Though I'm in the applied mathematics program, I'm mostly interested in Theoretical Physics, especially in space science. Currently, I'm working in plasma physics with prof. James Clemmons in the physics department where prof. Kai Germaschewski is my co-advisor. My work is to analyze the data collected by the missions flown to date to analyze the particles(their state), and electric and magnetic flux during an aurora. And then fit a curve, build up a code, or make a model out of it. We use different kinds of instruments like IG, IMS, ESA, etc. for this purpose. So, it is quite obvious that HPC is must needed tool to handle such big data. It helps to run codes in a smoother and more efficient way. Hence, HPC is such a course that will help me down the road toward my Ph.D. I'm looking forward to learning a lot from this class and utilizing them in my future endeavor.

Thank you.
Have a great semester everyone!
